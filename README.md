# PrettyLook_WebDesign
My project with web designing for a clothing boutique

I wanted to learn web development (full stack developer) and hence I started with web development courses on udemy and codeacademy.
This is my first experiment with front end design for my home boutique which has been created using HTML,CSS and bootstrap.
It will be further extended with javascript and than I will extend the back end
